**Create Test step for Uploading File**

To use file uploads in AssureQA, start by uploading the file user want to use into AssureQA Storage (Drive). 

Now that we've covered how to upload a file to the drive, let's move on to creating a test step using the uploaded file. Follow these steps:

**Step-1**

Click on the 'Drive-1' folder on the Drive page.

**Step-2**

On this page, user can copy the file path by clicking the button next to the name of the uploaded file.

**Step-3**

When copying the file path this way, the path includes the folder name preceding the file name.

For example, if the folder name is '**Drive-1'** and the file name is **'1.1-MB-1.jpg**', the copied path will be **'Drive-1/1.1-MB-1.jpg**'.

**Step-4**

Then, go to the test case page and select the ‘Upload File’ test case.

**Step-5**

Click on the upload file step, paste the copied path into the definition field, and click ‘Save’.

**Step-6**

Click ‘Run’ to execute the test case.
