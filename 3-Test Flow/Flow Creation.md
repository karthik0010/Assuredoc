# Flow Creation

 A group of test suites make up a flow. Test suites and their associated test cases are run, either in parallel or sequential mode, according to the configuration, when a flow is executed.

  **How to build a test flow ?**
To build a flow, Assureqa provides various nodes such as the suite node, delay, condition, and email node. Users can design a test flow based on their specific requirements using these nodes. Let's explore how to create a flow using these nodes.
