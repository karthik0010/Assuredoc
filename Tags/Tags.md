# TAGS

Tags are like labels that help sort things in a Testcases, Shared library, and Flow based on what the user likes. They're like quick ways to find and organize stuff, such as prioritizing tests, finding reusable code, or sorting process steps. Tags make it easy for users to manage and find things in their own way.
