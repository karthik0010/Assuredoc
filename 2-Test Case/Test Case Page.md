# Testcase

A test case is a structured set of steps and criteria used to assess whether a software program functions correctly. It defines what to do, what input to use, and what output to expect. Passing means the software works as intended, while failure indicates problems that need fixing. Test cases are vital for ensuring software quality and meeting specifications.
