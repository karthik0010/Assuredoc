Let's explore the process of creating a test case.  
Navigate to the test case page and click on "Create", where you'll find two options: "Record New Test Case" and "Blank Test Case."

**Recording testcase using Ui sensor**


1. If you wish to record a script using the UI sensor, choose the "Record new Test Case" option. If you prefer to manually create a script, opt for "Blank Test Case." Here let's record a test case using the UI sensor.
